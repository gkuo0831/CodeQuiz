This assignment was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript

# Issues:

This assignment was pretty hard for me, I could not get the final score to appear at the end of the quiz, but when you click highscore it goes to my final page html! Take a look around and try all the buttons.
